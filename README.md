Hey! Welcome to my repo :))))

I am Captain Magma, a passionate individual dedicated to cybersecurity, malware development, and analysis.

The design for this repository is to manage my MalDev road-path as I learn and update this repository with my notes and code.

> [!Important]
> I just wanted to clarify that I am __not__ an expert at all, I am noobish at best. That being said, please don't expect amazing APT sort of malware coming from this repo.
I also wanted to say that this repository is designed for educational purposes only. Not only will you get caught immediately with this code, but it is also **illegal** to do so on systems you do not own.

## Errors

I am not some sort of amazing programming, and that clearly reflects in my code. If there are any issues in any of my programs, feel free to make a pull request or point it out in the errors section!

## Thank You

With that being said, thanks for checking out my repo, and I hope you find something interesting:))))
