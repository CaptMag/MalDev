Hey! Welcome to my repo :))))

I am Captain Magma, a passionate individual dedicated to cybersecurity, malware development, and analysis.

The design for this repository is to manage my MalDev road-path as I learn and update this repository with my notes and code.

> [!Important]
> I just wanted to clarify that I am __not__ an expert at all, I am noobish at best. That being said, please don't expect amazing APT sort of malware coming from this repo.
I also wanted to say that this repository is designed for educational purposes only. Not only will you get caught immediately with this code, but it is also **illegal** to do so on systems you do not own.


## Current Projects and Standings


As of right now, this is a growing repository, and as such, there will be many updates for all the code here to ensure it works as intended.

- Encryption
    - [RC4](https://github.com/CaptMag/MalDev/tree/main/Encryption/RC4_Encryption)
    - [XOR](https://github.com/CaptMag/MalDev/tree/main/Encryption/XOR_Encryption)

- Native API
    - [NT APC](https://github.com/CaptMag/MalDev/tree/main/NTAPI/NT_APC)
    - [NT Shellcode Injection](https://github.com/CaptMag/MalDev/tree/main/NTAPI/NT_Shellcode_Injection)

- Process Injection
    - [APC Injection](https://github.com/CaptMag/MalDev/tree/main/Process_Injection/APC_Injection)
    - [Shellcode Injection](https://github.com/CaptMag/MalDev/tree/main/Process_Injection/Shellcode_Injection)

- System Calls
    - [Direct Syscalls](https://github.com/CaptMag/MalDev/tree/main/Syscalls/Direct_Syscalls)
    - [Indirect Syscalls](https://github.com/CaptMag/MalDev/tree/main/Syscalls/Indirect_Syscalls)


## Errors

I am not some sort of amazing programming, and that clearly reflects in my code. If there are any issues in any of my programs, feel free to make a pull request or point it out in the errors section!

## Thank You

With that being said, thanks for checking out my repo, and I hope you find something interesting:))))
